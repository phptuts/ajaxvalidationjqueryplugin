ajaxvalidationjqueryplugin
==========================

This jquery plugin depends on the jquery.form plugins and assumes you are using twitter bootstrap forms.  It will expects the errors to be returned like this:

['id_of_form_field' => ['error_message_one', 'error_message_two'] ].  I am going to come up with a demos and test for this bundle very soon.
